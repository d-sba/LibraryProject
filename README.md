# LibraryProject
The goal is to create a library programm to visualize, store and analyze information regarding my personal Book Collection.

We will proceed as follows:
  1. Cleaning of the Raw Data
  2. Design of the schema using the Entity-Relationship Model
  3. Creation and loading of the tables
  4. Execution of some querys to check that everything is as supposed

Then, we'll create a program which allows both to insert new books to the DB and make the desired querys
